# Smart Attendance System

## Overview

This is a Python-based Smart Attendance System that uses computer vision technology to automatically track employee attendance. The system currently uses OpenCV for face detection and Streamlit for the web interface, with plans to integrate full face recognition capabilities. It stores employee data and attendance records in a local SQLite database.

## Recent Changes

**January 28, 2025 - Core System Implementation:**
- ✓ Complete Streamlit web application with multi-page navigation
- ✓ SQLite database integration for employee and attendance management  
- ✓ OpenCV integration for real-time face detection
- ✓ Manual attendance marking system for testing
- ✓ Reports and analytics dashboard
- ✓ System status monitoring with dependency checks
- → Face recognition library installation in progress (dlib compilation issues)

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Frontend**: Streamlit web application providing a user-friendly interface
- **Backend**: Python modules handling face recognition, database operations, and attendance management
- **Database**: SQLite for local data storage
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV and face_recognition libraries for facial detection and recognition

## Key Components

### 1. Web Interface (app.py)
- **Purpose**: Main application entry point and user interface
- **Technology**: Streamlit framework
- **Features**: Multi-page navigation, live camera feed, employee management, reports
- **Caching**: Uses Streamlit's resource caching for system initialization

### 2. Face Recognition Engine (face_recognition_utils.py)
- **Purpose**: Handles all face detection and recognition operations
- **Technologies**: OpenCV Haar Cascades, face_recognition library
- **Key Features**:
  - Face detection using Haar Cascade classifiers
  - Face encoding generation for unique identification
  - Configurable recognition threshold (0.6 default)
  - Error handling for invalid images

### 3. Attendance Management (attendance_manager.py)
- **Purpose**: Core business logic for attendance tracking
- **Key Features**:
  - In-memory caching of known face encodings
  - Thread-safe operations with processing locks
  - Automatic cache refresh every 5 minutes
  - Integration with database and face recognition utilities

### 4. Database Layer (database.py)
- **Purpose**: Data persistence and retrieval
- **Technology**: SQLite with direct SQL queries
- **Schema Design**:
  - `employees` table: stores employee info and face encodings
  - `attendance` table: tracks check-in times and dates
  - Optimized with indexes for date and employee lookups

## Data Flow

1. **Employee Registration**: Face image → encoding generation → database storage
2. **Live Attendance**: Camera feed → face detection → encoding comparison → attendance logging
3. **Cache Management**: Database → in-memory cache → periodic refresh
4. **Reporting**: Database queries → data aggregation → visual presentation

## External Dependencies

### Core Libraries
- **Streamlit**: Web framework for the user interface
- **OpenCV (cv2)**: Computer vision operations and face detection
- **face_recognition**: Facial encoding and recognition
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations and array handling
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **PIL (Pillow)**: Image processing utilities

### Database
- **SQLite3**: Embedded database (no external server required)
- **Pickle**: Serialization for storing face encodings as binary data

## Deployment Strategy

### Local Development
- Single-file execution with `streamlit run app.py`
- All dependencies installed via pip
- SQLite database created automatically on first run

### Production Considerations
- **Database**: Currently uses SQLite (suitable for small-scale deployments)
- **Scalability**: In-memory caching with periodic refresh
- **Security**: Face encodings stored as binary data
- **Performance**: Configurable recognition thresholds and cache intervals

### System Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Webcam or camera device for live attendance
- Sufficient processing power for real-time face recognition
- Local file system access for SQLite database

## Architecture Decisions

### Database Choice: SQLite
- **Problem**: Need for persistent data storage without complex setup
- **Solution**: SQLite embedded database
- **Rationale**: Simple deployment, no server maintenance, suitable for small-scale use
- **Trade-offs**: Limited concurrent access, not suitable for high-volume enterprise use

### Face Recognition Approach: Dual-layer Detection
- **Problem**: Reliable face detection and recognition
- **Solution**: OpenCV for detection + face_recognition library for encoding
- **Rationale**: OpenCV is fast for detection, face_recognition provides accurate encodings
- **Trade-offs**: Requires two libraries but provides better accuracy

### Caching Strategy: In-memory with Refresh
- **Problem**: Performance optimization for repeated face comparisons
- **Solution**: Cache face encodings in memory with periodic refresh
- **Rationale**: Avoids database queries for every recognition attempt
- **Trade-offs**: Memory usage vs. performance gain

### Web Framework: Streamlit
- **Problem**: Need for rapid prototyping and user-friendly interface
- **Solution**: Streamlit for web application
- **Rationale**: Quick development, built-in components, Python-native
- **Trade-offs**: Less customizable than traditional web frameworks but much faster to develop
