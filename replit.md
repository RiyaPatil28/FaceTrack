## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Frontend**: Streamlit web application providing a user-friendly interface
- **Backend**: Python modules handling face recognition, database operations, and attendance management
- **Database**: SQLite for local data storage
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV and face_recognition libraries for facial detection and recognition

## Key Components

### 1. Web Interface (app.py)
- **Purpose**: Main application entry point and user interface
- **Technology**: Streamlit framework
- **Features**: Multi-page navigation, live camera feed, employee management, reports
- **Caching**: Uses Streamlit's resource caching for system initialization

### 2. Face Recognition Engine (face_recognition_utils.py)
- **Purpose**: Handles all face detection and recognition operations
- **Technologies**: OpenCV Haar Cascades, face_recognition library
- **Key Features**:
  - Face detection using Haar Cascade classifiers
  - Face encoding generation for unique identification
  - Configurable recognition threshold (0.6 default)
  - Error handling for invalid images

### 3. Attendance Management (attendance_manager.py)
- **Purpose**: Core business logic for attendance tracking
- **Key Features**:
  - In-memory caching of known face encodings
  - Thread-safe operations with processing locks
  - Automatic cache refresh every 5 minutes
  - Integration with database and face recognition utilities

### 4. Database Layer (database.py)
- **Purpose**: Data persistence and retrieval
- **Technology**: SQLite with direct SQL queries
- **Schema Design**:
  - `employees` table: stores employee info and face encodings
  - `attendance` table: tracks check-in times and dates
  - Optimized with indexes for date and employee lookups

### 5. Mobile API Server (mobile_api.py)
- **Purpose**: REST API for mobile app integration and remote attendance viewing
- **Technology**: Flask web framework
- **Key Features**:
  - RESTful endpoints for attendance data access
  - Real-time dashboard statistics
  - Employee management API
  - Attendance history and reporting
  - CSV export functionality
  - CORS support for mobile apps

## Data Flow

1. **Employee Registration**: Face image → encoding generation → database storage
2. **Live Attendance**: Camera feed → face detection → encoding comparison → attendance logging
3. **Cache Management**: Database → in-memory cache → periodic refresh
4. **Reporting**: Database queries → data aggregation → visual presentation

## External Dependencies

### Core Libraries
- **Streamlit**: Web framework for the user interface
- **OpenCV (cv2)**: Computer vision operations and face detection
- **face_recognition**: Facial encoding and recognition
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations and array handling
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **PIL (Pillow)**: Image processing utilities

### Database
- **SQLite3**: Embedded database (no external server required)
- **Pickle**: Serialization for storing face encodings as binary data

## Deployment Strategy

### Local Development
- Single-file execution with `streamlit run app.py`
- All dependencies installed via pip
- SQLite database created automatically on first run

### Production Considerations
- **Database**: Currently uses SQLite (suitable for small-scale deployments)
- **Scalability**: In-memory caching with periodic refresh
- **Security**: Face encodings stored as binary data
- **Performance**: Configurable recognition thresholds and cache intervals

### System Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Webcam or camera device for live attendance
- Sufficient processing power for real-time face recognition
- Local file system access for SQLite database

## Architecture Decisions

### Database Choice: SQLite
- **Problem**: Need for persistent data storage without complex setup
- **Solution**: SQLite embedded database
- **Rationale**: Simple deployment, no server maintenance, suitable for small-scale use
- **Trade-offs**: Limited concurrent access, not suitable for high-volume enterprise use

### Face Recognition Approach: Dual-layer Detection
- **Problem**: Reliable face detection and recognition
- **Solution**: OpenCV for detection + face_recognition library for encoding
- **Rationale**: OpenCV is fast for detection, face_recognition provides accurate encodings
- **Trade-offs**: Requires two libraries but provides better accuracy

### Caching Strategy: In-memory with Refresh
- **Problem**: Performance optimization for repeated face comparisons
- **Solution**: Cache face encodings in memory with periodic refresh
- **Rationale**: Avoids database queries for every recognition attempt
- **Trade-offs**: Memory usage vs. performance gain

### Web Framework: Streamlit
- **Problem**: Need for rapid prototyping and user-friendly interface
- **Solution**: Streamlit for web application
- **Rationale**: Quick development, built-in components, Python-native
- **Trade-offs**: Less customizable than traditional web frameworks but much faster to develop
